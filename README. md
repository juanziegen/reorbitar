üåç Overview
ReOrbit Ar is a project developed in the NASA Space Apps Challenge.  
Our mission is to transform the growing problem of orbital debris into an opportunity for sustainable space infrastructure.  

Currently, thousands of inactive satellites and fragments orbit Earth, generating dangerous traffic for active missions. Their only planned destiny is controlled destruction in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. ReOrbit Ar proposes an alternative that does not yet exist: recycling and reusing orbital debris directly in space.


üõ∞Ô∏è How It Works
1. Collector Drone
   A robotic vehicle captures inactive satellites and debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

2. Recycling Module (ISS)
   The materials are delivered to a recycling module attached to the International Space Station, where they are classified, processed, and transformed into usable resources (e.g., metals, polymers, 3D printing filaments).

3. Storage Module
   Once filled, a detachable storage module is moved to a higher, stable orbit. These orbital warehouses preserve resources for future use or commercial sale.


 üîó Blockchain Marketplace

A key component of ReOrbit Ar is the creation of a transparent and secure orbital resource marketplace powered by blockchain technology.

- Tokenized Resources  
  Each batch of recycled material is represented as a digital token (NFT or fungible token), ensuring proof of origin, composition, and availability.

- Smart Contracts
  Automated contracts manage transactions between orbital operators, research institutions, and private companies. This guarantees fair pricing, instant settlement, and reduced administrative overhead.

- Traceability & Trust 
  Blockchain provides an immutable record of every step: from debris collection, to recycling, to orbital storage, and finally to commercial sale. This ensures accountability and builds trust among stakeholders.

- Global Accessibility
  Any authorized entity on Earth or in orbit can access the marketplace, purchase resources, and schedule orbital deliveries.


 üí≥ Credit System for Satellite Owners

To encourage participation from satellite operators, ReOrbit Ar introduces a credit-based incentive model:

- Contribution Credits  
  When a company delivers its inactive satellite to the recycling system, a percentage of the recovered materials is converted into credits.

- Material-Based Valuation  
  Each material type (metals, polymers, electronics) has a specific credit value, reflecting its scarcity and utility in orbit.

- Redeemable Assets 
  Credits can later be exchanged for recycled materials stored in orbital depots, allowing companies to access resources when and where they need them.

- Integration with Blockchain  
  Credits are tokenized on the blockchain marketplace, ensuring transparency, traceability, and secure transactions between orbital stakeholders.


üåå Vision
We imagine a future where:
- Orbital debris becomes the foundation of a circular economy in space.  
- Companies can purchase recycled materials directly in orbit, reducing launch costs.  
- Humanity builds sustainable infrastructure beyond Earth while protecting our planet‚Äôs environment.
