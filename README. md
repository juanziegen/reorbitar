# ReOrbit Ar 🚀

🌍 Overview
ReOrbit Ar is a project developed in the NASA Space Apps Challenge.  
Our mission is to transform the growing problem of orbital debris into an opportunity for sustainable space infrastructure.  

Currently, thousands of inactive satellites and fragments orbit Earth, generating dangerous traffic for active missions. Their only planned destiny is controlled destruction in Earth’s atmosphere. **ReOrbit Ar proposes an alternative that does not yet exist: recycling and reusing orbital debris directly in space.

🛰️ How It Works
1. **Collector Drone**
   A robotic vehicle captures inactive satellites and debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

2. **Recycling Module (ISS)**  
   The materials are delivered to a recycling module attached to the International Space Station, where they are classified, processed, and transformed into usable resources (e.g., metals, polymers, 3D printing filaments).

3. **Storage Module**  
   Once filled, a detachable storage module is moved to a higher, stable orbit. These orbital warehouses preserve resources for future use or commercial sale.

## 🌌 Vision
We imagine a future where:
- Orbital debris becomes the foundation of a **circular economy in space**.  
- Companies can **purchase recycled materials directly in orbit**, reducing launch costs.  
- Humanity builds **sustainable infrastructure beyond Earth** while protecting our planet’s environment.
